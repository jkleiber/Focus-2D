Focus 2D is a game engine I created to run my own games on.

Focus 2D started out largely based on the Kilobolt Android Framework, which can be found here: http://www.kilobolt.com/create-an-android-game-from-scratch-or-port-your-existing-game.html. Over time Focus 2D has evolved to feature a interpolating rendering engine, and to work better with Android Activities, making it very different from its beginnings. Now it is also a bit more plug-and-play, but is still under active development.

This repository only contains the source files and the java documentation for Focus2D.
It does not include build files generated by Android Studio.

You need to import the source files, or just copy them into your own Android Studio Project for the engine to work. For examples on how to use the engine, see my other Github Repository Rocketeer.
